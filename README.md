TYPO3 extension standaloneview
==============================

## What does it do?

This little TYPO3 extension demonstrate how to control the language used in a Fluid StandaloneView when rendering the view in the TYPO3 backend context.

I contains a backend module, where you can choose the language translated labels should be rendered in. It also contains a commandController which
can be used from a scheduler task.
